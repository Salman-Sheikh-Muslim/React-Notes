CSS-in-JS is an approach to styling web applications where styles are written 
directly within JavaScript or TypeScript files. This allows developers to manage 
styles and component logic in a more cohesive manner. Let's delve into the specific 
points you've mentioned:

1. **Scoped Styles:**
   - In CSS-in-JS, styles are typically scoped to the component they are associated 
   with. This means that the styles defined for a particular component do not leak or 
   affect other components in the application. This is achieved by generating unique 
   class names or using other mechanisms to ensure isolation.

2. **All the CSS & JS/TS Code in One Place:**
   - CSS-in-JS consolidates both the styling and logic of a component into a single 
   file, often within the same JavaScript or TypeScript module. This makes it easier 
   for developers to understand, manage, and maintain code, as everything related to 
   a specific component is contained in one location.

3. **Easier to Delete a Component:**
   - Since the styles are directly associated with the component they are styling, 
   deleting a component becomes simpler. Developers can remove the entire module 
   containing the component's code and styles, ensuring that there are no lingering 
   or unused styles left in the application.

4. **Easier to Style Based on Props/State:**
   - With CSS-in-JS, styles can be dynamically generated based on the props or state 
   of a component. This allows for more dynamic and responsive styling, as the styles 
   can adapt based on the changing state or properties of the component. This can 
   lead to more modular and reusable styling logic.

In summary, CSS-in-JS provides a more cohesive and encapsulated approach to styling 
in web development. It brings the styling and logic closer together, making it easier 
to manage, delete, and style components based on dynamic factors such as props or 
state. It also addresses the challenge of scoped styles, ensuring that styles are 
isolated to the components they are intended for, preventing global styling conflicts.
