All of these Hooks can only be called the top level of our component.
We cannot call them inside loop or if statements etc.
We can call the same Hook multiple times for different purposes.

useState
D:\VS Code\React-Notes\react-project\src\components\ListGroup_useState.tsx

useRef
D:\VS Code\React-Notes\react-creating-forms\src\components\Form-useRef.tsx

________

useEffect

Usages:
Store data in local storage
Call the server to fetch/save data
Manually modify the DOM

With Effect Hook we can tell React to execute a piece of code after the component
has been rendered.

A piece of code that has nothing to do with returning some JSX markup instead it
is doing some other work such as changimg the state of DOM than we say that piece
of code has a Side Effect.

When we multiple Effect hooks React will run them in order after each render.

Compononete that have a piece of code that result in a side Effect are no longer
oure componenets.

Side Effects can be resolved by usinf the Effect hook; making the vomponent pure again.
