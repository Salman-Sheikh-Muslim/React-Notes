To create a new react component you add a new file into the 'src' flder.

The extension of that fil can be ts or tsx.
Quite often ts is used for plain typescript files and tsx for React components.

There are 2 ways to create a react component by using a JavaScript class or a function.

Function based components are more popular because they are easier to right and more
concise.

When creating function components in React use PascalCasing. This is expected by developers
and required by React.
