Updating Server Data:

There are 2 approaches when it comes to updating data in the server.

Optomistic Update 
Pessimistic Update 

Optomistic Update:
Fast UI
We assume the request will be a success so:
first we update the UI and then we call the Server.

Pessimistic Update:
Slow UI
We assume the request will be a fail so:
first we call the Server and then we update the UI..

____________________

    /*
    We have 2 options for updating.

    axios.put //replaces the object

    axios.patch //updating 1 or more properties of the object. 

    The method we choose really depend on how the backend is built.
    Some backends do not support the patch method they only support the'put method.
