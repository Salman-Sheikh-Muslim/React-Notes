What is Purity?

In computer science a function when given the same input, always returns the
same result is known as a Pure Function.

Pure Function
function sum(a + b){

    return a + b; //always returns the same reult on same input
}

Impure Function:
function generateRandomNumber(maximumValue) {
  // Ensure that the parameter is a positive number
  if (typeof maximumValue !== 'number' || maximumValue <= 0) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input. Please provide a positive number.');
  }

  // Generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and the specified maximum value (exclusive)
  const randomNumber = Math.random() * maximumValue; //does not return the same reult on same input

  // Return the random number
  return randomNumber;
}

Now React is desgined around this concept. It expects every component we create to
be a pure function.

So if we give it the same inputs (props) it should always return thr same JSX and
this is for performance resons. So if the inputs of the components have not changed
React can skip 're-rendering' that component.


To keep components pure we should keep any kind of changes out of the render phase.
We should not change any object that exsisted before rendering. But note that its 
totally fine to updat any variable or object that we created as part of rendering.


/* Each ImpureComponents is rendered twice due to StrictMode as well as other
      components.
      
      Reach renders each ImpureComponents twice and takes the result of the
      second render
      
            <ImpureComponents /> Message 1 // The first render is primarily ussed for 
                                              detecting and reporting potential issues 
                                              with our code while the second 
                                              render is actually used for updating the 
                                              user interface.
                                 Message 2 // React takes the result of the second 
                                              render.

Messages coming from the StrictMode are greyed out in the console. In React18 StrictMode
is turned on by default and as a result React renders each component twice. StrictMode
helps us find ImpureComponents (as we do not see the result we expect).

It only behaves this way in development mode, so when we built our 
application for production the StrictMode checks are not included and our
components will render only once.
